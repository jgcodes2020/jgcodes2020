## About me
I'm a 12th grade student who mostly focuses on low-level programming and dabbles in computer graphics.

## Stuff I'm doing
**Under active development**
- A full rewrite of [Mupen64-RR](https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-) using modern frameworks and emulators
  - **[mupen64plus-core-rr](https://github.com/Mupen64-Rewrite/mupen64plus-core-rr)**: Fork of the Mupen64Plus emulator
  [core](https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-core) supporting input recording and video capture.
  - **M64RPFW**: C#/Avalonia-based GUI for [mupen64plus-core-rr](https://github.com/Mupen64-Rewrite/mupen64plus-core-rr). The
  repository is private right now, so I can't link it.
